# 10_email_client_fh_aachen
My very first python project at FH Aachen

Notes:
1. This e-mail client works for send an e-mail from university account to university's employee.
2. The lists from the employees are collected from the university's website using BeautifulSoup.
3. The GUI-design is optimized for Mac-OS using x-, y- coordinates.
